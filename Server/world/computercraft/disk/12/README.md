# CloverOS

An Operating System for CC:Tweaked and CraftOS

## About CloverOS

CloverOS is a custom Minecraft operating system designed for the CC:Tweaked mod and CraftOS.  
It draws inspiration from Minux and Windows 10/11, combining the lightweight structure of Minux with a modern and user-friendly design inspired by Windows.

CloverOS is a complete rewrite built to feel like a desktop environment inside Minecraft.  
Originally based on Minux concepts, it has since been redesigned and reimplemented independently.

Note: We previously had issues with the file scraper while examining the Minux source code, but those problems have now been resolved.
